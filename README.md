### `platformctl` — declarative data infrastructure on container runtimes

*Describe your data platform as resources. Plan the diff. Apply it. Watch a
Postgres → Debezium → Redpanda → S3 pipeline reach `Ready` from a directory
of YAML.*

Datascape treats the *infrastructure of a data platform* — databases, event
streams, CDC connectors, object storage, sinks — the way Kubernetes treats
workloads and Terraform treats cloud resources: a **typed resource model**,
a **deterministic plan**, an **idempotent reconciliation engine**, and
**drift-aware status**, all from one static binary.

```console
$ platformctl apply ./platform/ --auto-approve
ok   Provider/local-redpanda        (create) in 2.7s
ok   EventStream/attendance-events  (create) in 213ms
ok   Provider/local-postgres        (create) in 2.7s
ok   Provider/postgres-cdc          (create) in 6.7s
ok   Source/student-database        (create) in 53ms
ok   Binding/student-db-to-events   (create) in 254ms   # Debezium connector: RUNNING
...
applied: 14 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 skipped
```

## ✨ Highlights

- **Declarative, diff-driven** — `plan` is computed purely from manifests +
  recorded state (never live probing), so it is deterministic and
  reviewable; `apply` reconciles in dependency order and re-applying an
  unchanged set makes **zero mutating calls**.
- **A real pipeline, end-to-end** — the provider set covers a working
  lakehouse: Redpanda, Postgres, MySQL/MariaDB, Debezium CDC, MinIO/S3, a
  Kafka-Connect S3 sink, Nessie (Iceberg REST catalog), Marquez
  (OpenLineage backend), and a proxy surface giving external systems stable
  platform-owned entrypoints. Rows inserted into Postgres land as objects
  in a bucket with nothing hand-wired in between.
- **Orchestrator-ready** — `examples/lakehouse/` stands up the
  infrastructure a Dagster deployment runs against: object store, an
  Iceberg `Catalog`, a lineage backend, relational stores, and a managed
  `Connection` giving an external database a stable platform-owned
  entrypoint (with CDC flowing through it) — every endpoint your
  orchestrator connects to, documented.
- **Provider-agnostic resource model** — the manifests speak nouns
  (`Catalog`, `Connection`, `Source`, `EventStream`, `Dataset`);
  technologies (Nessie, socat, Postgres, Redpanda) are engines *realizing*
  them, capability-checked at `validate`.
- **Capability-checked bindings** — a `Binding(mode: cdc)` against a
  provider that can't do CDC, or a `sink` to a format the connector can't
  write, fails at `validate` with a precise error — not at 2 a.m. during
  `apply`.
- **Safety in the engine, not in conventions** — external resources are
  never destroyed without explicit, separate opt-in flags; failed destroys
  block teardown of their dependencies; unmanaged Docker objects are never
  touched (everything Datascape owns is labeled).
- **Built for out-of-band failure** — `drift` probes live infrastructure
  and records what it finds; `apply` heals drifted resources (a killed
  container is recreated, a stopped one restarted, a failed connector
  restarted) while `plan` stays deterministic and never mutates; `destroy`
  converges even when half the platform is already dead. All of it enforced
  by a chaos-monkey integration suite in CI.
- **Secrets stay out of manifests** — `SecretReference` resources resolve
  through pluggable backends (`env`, `file`, and gated `vault`); specs carry
  names, never values, and the schemas make a plaintext value unrepresentable.
- **Lineage-aware by design** — `metadata.observers` forwards a resolved
  `LineageEndpoint` to providers that consume one (Debezium's native
  OpenLineage integration), and degrades to an informational condition when
  they don't.
- **Feature-gated evolution** — every provider ships behind a gate
  (`--feature-gates=Name=true|false`), so `main` is always releasable.

## 🏗 Architecture

Strict hexagonal layering — the entire design hangs on one invariant:
**domain and ports never import an adapter.**

| Layer | Rule |
|---|---|
| `internal/domain` | Imports nothing else in this repo. Resource kinds, graph, lineage types. |
| `internal/ports` | Interfaces only (+ conformance suites). Imports `domain`. |
| `internal/adapters` | Implement ports; may import third-party SDKs. Every adapter passes its port's conformance suite. |
| `cmd/platformctl`, `application/registry` | The **only** places allowed to import concrete adapters. |

### The resource model

Eight kinds, one worked scenario:

```
Source(postgres) ──Binding(mode: cdc)──▶ EventStream ──Binding(mode: sink)──▶ Dataset(bucket/prefix)
      │                    │                  │                  │                    │
  Provider(postgres)  Provider(debezium)  Provider(redpanda)  Provider(s3sink)   Provider(minio)
                                                                          SecretReference(env) ⤴

Catalog(engine: nessie)      # a table catalog as a noun — engines realize it
Connection(port, target)     # a stable entrypoint to a system that lives elsewhere;
                             # external resources integrate through it (address here,
                             # credentials in the SecretReference its secretRef names)
```

`Binding` is the connective tissue: a directed edge whose `mode` names the
movement mechanism, admitting a *set* of Kind pairings (`cdc`:
Source→EventStream; `sink`: EventStream→Dataset or EventStream→Source —
databases are legitimate sinks; `ingest`: Dataset→EventStream — object
stores are legitimate sources). The referenced provider must declare the
capability interface matching the pairing — all enforced at `validate`.
Asset kinds are role-neutral; direction lives in the Binding
(docs/design/001-bindings-are-directed-edges.md).

## 🚀 Quickstart

**Prerequisites:** Go 1.22+, a running Docker daemon.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rezarajan/platformctl && cd platformctl
just build        # → bin/platformctl
```

Run the full CDC-to-object-storage acceptance scenario:

```sh
# one-time: the sink Connect image (stock images ship no S3 sink plugin)
docker build -t datascape-s3sink-connect:local examples/cdc-attendance/s3sink-image/

# credentials resolve from the environment — see examples/cdc-attendance/README.md
export DATASCAPE_SECRET_POSTGRES_ADMIN_CREDS_USERNAME=admin
export DATASCAPE_SECRET_POSTGRES_ADMIN_CREDS_PASSWORD=admin-pw
export DATASCAPE_SECRET_POSTGRES_REPLICATION_CREDS_USERNAME=repl
export DATASCAPE_SECRET_POSTGRES_REPLICATION_CREDS_PASSWORD=repl-pw
export DATASCAPE_SECRET_MINIO_ROOT_CREDS_USERNAME=minioadmin
export DATASCAPE_SECRET_MINIO_ROOT_CREDS_PASSWORD=minioadmin-pw

bin/platformctl validate examples/cdc-attendance/
bin/platformctl apply    examples/cdc-attendance/ --auto-approve
bin/platformctl status   examples/cdc-attendance/
```

Insert a row, watch it land in the lake:

```sh
psql postgres://admin:admin-pw@localhost:15432/studentdb \
  -c "CREATE TABLE students (id serial PRIMARY KEY, name text);
      INSERT INTO students (name) VALUES ('alice'), ('bob');"

mc alias set local http://localhost:19000 minioadmin minioadmin-pw
mc ls --recursive local/raw-events/       # objects appear within ~30s
```

Only tables declared on the CDC Binding (`options.tables`) are captured —
add a table there and re-apply to widen the stream; the connector is
reconfigured in place. See the
[example README](examples/cdc-attendance/README.md#capturing-another-table).

Tear it all down (reverse dependency order, labeled objects only):

```sh
bin/platformctl destroy examples/cdc-attendance/ --auto-approve
```

## 🖥 CLI surface

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `validate <dir>` | Schema + graph (cycles) + Binding capability checks. No state, no runtime calls. |
| `plan <dir>` | Deterministic diff of manifests vs. state. Exit `1` when changes are pending. |
| `apply <dir>` | Reconcile in topological order; state persisted after every resource. |
| `status <dir>` | Per-resource `Ready`/`DRIFT`/conditions/lifecycle from recorded state. |
| `drift <dir>` | Probe live infrastructure, record observed conditions into state, report drift. Exit `1` when drift is found; run `apply` to heal it. |
| `graph <dir> -o dot\|mermaid` | Render the dependency DAG. |
| `import <Kind>/<name> --from <name>` | Adopt a pre-existing backing object into state as Imported (probe, never create). Gated by `ImportedResources`. |
| `docs build\|serve` | Generate/serve the resource reference from `schemas/`. |
| `destroy <dir>` | Reverse-order teardown. `--include-external` additionally requires `--yes-i-understand-this-is-destructive`. |

Global flags: `--state-file` (default `.datascape/state.json`),
`--feature-gates`, `-o table|json|yaml`.

## 🧪 Development

```sh
just build             # CGO_ENABLED=0 static build
just test              # unit + contract tests (no Docker)
just test-integration  # real Docker: runtime conformance + Redpanda/CDC/sink e2e
just check             # gofmt + go vet (both build-tag variants)
```

The integration suite stands up real Postgres, Debezium, Redpanda, and MinIO
containers on non-default host ports and verifies the roadmap's exit
criteria literally — including "re-apply makes zero mutating calls" and
"destroy leaves no orphans". A chaos-monkey suite additionally kills and
stops managed containers out-of-band (and SIGKILLs the CLI mid-apply) and
requires drift reporting, healing, recovery, and convergent teardown.

**Adding a provider:** implement `reconciler.Provider` (plus capability
interfaces you support), register it in `application/registry` wiring behind
a feature gate, and cover it with an integration test. The engine hands you
your `Provider` resource, resolved secrets, and the full resource set via
optional `*Aware` interfaces — see `internal/adapters/providers/redpanda`
for the smallest complete example.

## 📚 Documentation

The `docs/planning/` package is the source of truth:

| Doc | Contents |
|---|---|
| [01-product-requirements](docs/planning/01-product-requirements.md) | What Datascape is (and deliberately isn't). |
| [02-architecture](docs/planning/02-architecture.md) | Layering, ports, capability interfaces, error contracts. |
| [03-resource-model-reference](docs/planning/03-resource-model-reference.md) | Every Kind, field by field. |
| [04-roadmap-and-feature-gates](docs/planning/04-roadmap-and-feature-gates.md) | Phases 0–8 with checkable exit criteria. |
| [05-v1-first-version-spec](docs/planning/05-v1-first-version-spec.md) | The precise v1.0.0 definition of done. |

**Roadmap status:** v1.0.0 is declared — phases 0–5 (foundations, Docker
runtime, Redpanda, CDC + lineage mechanism, object-storage sink,
import/external lifecycles + drift) are complete with every exit criterion
automated, and the spec §6 acceptance scenario runs in CI against the
literal example manifests. Phase 6's committed scope (parallel
reconciliation behind the ParallelReconciliation gate, vault and file
secret backends) is done; the optional openlineage provider is future work.
Binding taxonomy is a relation over role-neutral asset kinds — database-as-
sink and object-store-as-source are schema-stable pairings awaiting
providers (see docs/design/001-bindings-are-directed-edges.md).
